    <p id="p1">"Fashion is about the clothes and accessories we wear. It shows how we like to dress and express ourselves.
     Different people have different styles. Some like to wear bright, colorful clothes, while others prefer simple,
     neutral colors. Fashion changes all the time, and new trends come every season."
